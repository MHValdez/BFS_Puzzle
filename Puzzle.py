Description: Submission for homework problem 3.
             Function that uses a queue implementation of BFS to find
             and return the shortest path from a source to a destination
             on a board.

Note:        Extra credit (problem 3d) implemented.

    """
    Determines a shortest path from Source to Destination on Board
    using a queue based BFS. Valid moves are to adjacent, traversable
    spaces (see Board param). Graph of board is unweighted; all moves
    have a cost of 1.

    :param Board:   list of list of strings representing a 2D puzzle board.
                    Outer list represents rows, inner list represents
                    columns, and strings respresent spaces. All strings
                    must be '-' or '#' where '-' is traversable and '#'
                    is blocked.
    :param Source:      tuple of two ints representing the indexed address
                        of the starting space
